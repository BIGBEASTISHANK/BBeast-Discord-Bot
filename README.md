# Discord Bot in C++

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is on hold because I am banned from the D++ Discord server and the GitHub repo. That's why I am losing motivation to work on it. If you want, I should work on it. Please help me get unbanned. The reason I am banned is that, first, I jokingly said I am 12, and then I got angry because they banned me for being 12 and trashed talking to the owner of the project. I apologized but didn't get any response.
